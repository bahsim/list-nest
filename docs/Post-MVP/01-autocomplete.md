## Prompt

Act as a NestList Product Manager and suggest how to ornaize autocompletion according to best practices?

## Result

**As a NestList Product Manager, here’s how I’d organize autocompletion for product entry, following best practices:**

---

### 1. **Data Source Strategy**
- **Hybrid approach:**  
  - **Local static list** of most common products for instant, offline, and privacy-friendly suggestions.
  - **Remote API fallback** (e.g., Open Food Facts) for long-tail/rare items, fetched as user types.

### 2. **UX/UI**
- **Debounced input:**  
  - Wait 200–300ms after user stops typing before querying remote API.
- **Show suggestions dropdown:**  
  - Top: local matches (prioritized by frequency/recent use).
  - Below: remote matches (visually separated, e.g., “More results…”).
- **Highlight matching substring** in suggestions.
- **Keyboard navigation:**  
  - Up/Down to select, Enter to confirm, Esc to close.
- **Loading indicator** for remote fetches.
- **No results:**  
  - Show “No matches found. Add as new product?”

### 3. **Performance**
- **Cache remote results** (per session) to avoid duplicate requests.
- **Limit remote results** (e.g., top 10).
- **Preload local list** at app start.

### 4. **Personalization**
- **Track user’s recent and frequent products** (localStorage or backend).
- **Show “recently used” at top** when input is empty.

### 5. **Internationalization**
- **Support multiple languages** in both local and remote lists.
- **Normalize input** (case, diacritics).

### 6. **Accessibility**
- **ARIA roles** for dropdown.
- **Screen reader support** for suggestions.

### 7. **Security/Privacy**
- **Sanitize all input/output.**
- **Don’t send user-typed data to remote API until minimum length (e.g., 2–3 chars).**

**Summary Table:**

| Aspect           | Best Practice                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data             | Local + remote hybrid, cache remote, prioritize local                         |
| UX               | Debounce, highlight, keyboard nav, loading, “add new” option                  |
| Performance      | Cache, limit results, preload local                                           |
| Personalization  | Recent/frequent products, top of list                                         |
| i18n             | Multi-language, normalize input                                               |
| Accessibility    | ARIA roles, screen reader support                                             |
| Security/Privacy | Sanitize, min length for remote, don’t leak user data                         |


**Extra:**  
- Consider analytics on what’s being searched/added (anonymized) to improve the local list.
- Allow users to add custom products if not found.

## Prompt

Is it good idea to manage items catalog?
If yes, globally on app level or each user specific one?

## Result

**Yes, it’s a good idea to manage an items catalog.**

**Why:**  
- Consistent naming (no “milk”, “Milk”, “молоко” as separate items)
- Enables autocompletion, analytics, and sharing
- Reduces duplicates and typos
- Allows for richer metadata (emoji, category, nutrition, etc.)

**How to scope it:**  
- **Global catalog:**  
  - Core, canonical list of items (bread, milk, etc.)  
  - Shared by all users  
  - Maintained/curated by you (or crowd-sourced with moderation)
- **User-specific catalog:**  
  - User can add custom items not in global catalog  
  - User’s own aliases, favorites, or “private” items  
  - Synced with their account

**Best practice:**  
- **Hybrid:**  
  - Use a global catalog for 90% of cases  
  - Allow user-specific extensions (custom items, nicknames, etc.)  
  - When user adds a new item, suggest matching global items first, then allow “add custom”  
  - Optionally, let users suggest new items for global catalog (with moderation)

**Summary:**  
- **Global catalog:** for consistency, analytics, and sharing  
- **User-specific:** for flexibility and personalization  
- **Hybrid:** best of both worlds

**Don’t:**  
- Only use user-specific (fragmented, no network effect)
- Only use global (frustrates users with niche needs)

**Do:**  
- Use global as default, user-specific as fallback/extensions

Let me know if you want a schema or code example.
