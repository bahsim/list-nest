### Prompt

There is a UI Kit and src/features folders - how they corelate and seems smelly architecture - reflecton it as a pro

### Result

You’re right to be skeptical—this is a classic “smell” in modern React/TypeScript monorepos.

#### What you have:
- **UI Kit** (`@ui-kit/components/...`):  
  Centralized, generic, reusable UI components (atoms, molecules, organisms, etc).  
  These should be “dumb” (stateless, style-focused, no business logic), and used everywhere.
- **features/**:  
  App-specific business logic, state, and feature composition.  
  These are “smart” (stateful, business logic, data fetching, etc), and compose UI Kit components.

#### The architectural smell:
- If your features are importing from UI Kit, that’s good.
- If your UI Kit is importing from features, that’s **bad** (circular, anti-modular).
- If you find yourself duplicating types, logic, or even UI between the two, that’s a sign of unclear boundaries.
- If your UI Kit contains business logic, or your features folder contains generic UI, you’re mixing concerns.

#### How it should work (best practice):

- **UI Kit**:  
  - Only exports generic, reusable, stateless components.
  - No business logic, no app-specific types, no feature-specific code.
  - Can be published as a package, used in multiple projects.
- **features/**:  
  - Contains all business logic, state, and feature-specific composition.
  - Imports and composes UI Kit components.
  - Can use hooks, context, etc.
  - Can have feature-specific types, but should use shared types for data models.

- **Shared types**:  
  - If you have types that are used by both UI Kit and features (e.g., `ShoppingListItem`), put them in a `@types` or `common/types` package/folder.
  - UI Kit and features both import from there, never from each other.

#### What’s smelly in your setup?
- If `@ui-kit/components/types` contains business types (like `ShoppingListItem`), that’s a leak.  
  Those types should be in a shared types folder/package, not in the UI Kit.
- If features are importing types from UI Kit, you’re coupling business logic to UI, which is backwards.
- If you ever need to use a feature component in the UI Kit, you’ll get a circular dependency.

#### How to fix:
1. **Move all shared types** (e.g., `ShoppingListItem`, `User`) to `src/types/` or `src/common/types/`.
2. **Update UI Kit and features** to import from `src/types/`, not from each other.
3. **Keep UI Kit “dumb”** and features “smart”.

**Summary:**  
- UI Kit: only generic, stateless, style-focused components, imports only shared types.
- features: business logic, state, composition, imports UI Kit and shared types.
- shared types: in their own folder/package, imported by both.

### Prompt

My next concern that from using MUI components prospective, it seems redundant to have UI kit package as they duplicate each other as well

### Result

You’re absolutely right—this is a super common pain point in React projects that use a design system like MUI **and** try to maintain a custom UI Kit.

### The problem:
- **MUI** already provides a huge set of well-designed, themeable, accessible, and composable UI primitives (Button, Card, List, etc).
- **Your UI Kit** often just wraps or slightly customizes MUI components, sometimes adding little value, sometimes just renaming, sometimes introducing unnecessary indirection.
- This leads to:
  - Redundant abstraction layers.
  - Extra maintenance (every MUI upgrade, you have to check your wrappers).
  - Confusion: “Should I use MUI directly, or our UI Kit? What’s the difference?”
  - Slower adoption of new MUI features.
  - Potential for style/theme drift if your UI Kit gets out of sync with MUI.

### When a UI Kit makes sense:
- You have **real, reusable, branded components** that are more than just MUI with a different name (e.g., a `UserAvatar` that always applies your brand’s avatar logic, or a `BrandedButton` with custom logic).
- You want to **enforce design tokens, themes, or patterns** that MUI alone can’t.
- You need to **abstract away** MUI so you can swap it out later (rarely needed in practice).

### When it’s just bloat:
- If your UI Kit is just a thin wrapper around MUI, or you find yourself writing `<MyButton {...props} />` that just renders `<Button {...props} />`, you’re not adding value.
- If you’re duplicating MUI’s API, you’re just creating friction.

### Pro take:
- **Don’t wrap MUI unless you’re adding real value.**
- Use MUI directly for most things.
- Only create a UI Kit component when:
  - You have a real, reusable pattern (e.g., a `HeaderBar` that always includes your logo, user menu, etc).
  - You want to encapsulate a complex composition of MUI components.
  - You want to enforce a prop contract or add business logic (rare for UI).

### What to do:
- Audit your UI Kit. For each component, ask: “Does this add value beyond MUI?”
  - If not, delete it and use MUI directly.
  - If yes, keep it, but make sure it’s well-documented and not just a wrapper.
- For new features, prefer MUI directly unless you see a clear pattern emerging.

### TL;DR
- Don’t build a UI Kit just to rename or wrap MUI.
- Use MUI directly unless you’re adding real, reusable, branded value.
- Keep your codebase lean, clear, and easy to onboard new devs.

### Result

#### 1. **What’s in your UI Kit?**
- **Some components (like `EmptyState`)**:  
  These are legit value-adds—they compose MUI primitives into a reusable, branded pattern (image, title, description, CTA).  
  **Keep these.**
- **Some components (like `ShoppingList`)**:  
  These add sorting, composition, and business logic on top of MUI’s List.  
  **Keep these if the logic is reused and not trivial.**
- **Some components (like `HeaderBar`)**:  
  This is a real composition: logo, user avatar, settings, branding.  
  **Keep these.**

---

#### 2. **What’s redundant?**
- If you have components that are just `<Button {...props} />` or `<Box {...props} />` with no added value, **delete them** and use MUI directly.
- If you have “wrappers” that only rename MUI components, **delete them**.

---

#### 3. **What’s the right pattern?**
- **UI Kit = “branded composition”**:  
  Only keep components that:
  - Compose multiple MUI primitives into a pattern you use in multiple places.
  - Add real business or design value (not just renaming).
  - Enforce your design system (e.g., always use your color palette, always show a logo, etc).
- **Use MUI directly for everything else.**
- **Don’t wrap MUI just to wrap it.**

---

#### 4. **How to clean up:**
- Audit your UI Kit. For each component:
  - If it’s just a thin wrapper, delete it and use MUI directly.
  - If it’s a real composition, keep it.
- For new features, **start with MUI**. Only extract to UI Kit when you see a real pattern.

---

#### 5. **What about types?**
- Shared types (like `ShoppingListItem`) should live in a `types/` or `common/types/` folder, not in the UI Kit.

---

#### TL;DR
- **Keep UI Kit for real, branded, reusable compositions.**
- **Use MUI directly for everything else.**
- **Don’t duplicate MUI’s API.**
- **Move shared types out of UI Kit.**
