# GenAI Workflow for Design (MVP)

## 1. Screen-to-Component Mapping
- Upload Excalidraw PNGs to a GenAI tool (e.g., ChatGPT Vision, Galileo AI, Figma AI plugin).
- Prompt: "Identify UI kit components in this screen based on our component library. Output a table: [Screen Element, UI Kit Component, Props/State]."
- Review and edit the mapping as needed.

## 2. Content Generation
- Use GenAI to generate placeholder text, button labels, error messages, and sample data.
- Prompt: "Generate realistic placeholder content for a grocery list app."

## 3. Accessibility Review
- Upload screenshots or code snippets to GenAI.
- Prompt: "Check this UI for accessibility issues (WCAG AA), suggest improvements."

## 4. Annotated Screens
- Use GenAI to overlay component names on PNGs for handoff.
- Prompt: "Overlay component names from our mapping table onto this screen PNG."

## 5. Documentation
- Use GenAI to summarize or generate docs/checklists from your mapping and guidelines.

## 6. Iteration
- Repeat the process for new screens/components as the MVP evolves.
