## 1. Data Model (TypeScript)

```typescript
/** @typedef {Represents a shopping list item.} */
export interface ShoppingListItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  quantity: string;
  estimatedPrice: number;
  category: string;
  isFocused: boolean;
  isBought: boolean;
  addedBy: string; // userId
  addedAt: Date;
  boughtAt?: Date;
}

/** @typedef {Represents a user.} */
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  avatarUrl?: string;
}

/** @typedef {Represents an AI suggestion.} */
export interface AISuggestion {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  quantity: string;
  estimatedPrice: number;
  category: string;
}
```

## 2. UI Component Structure (React/NestJS/Angular style)

- `HeaderBar`
  - AppLogo
  - UserProfileDropdown
  - SettingsButton

- `ShoppingList`
  - `ShoppingListItemCard[]`
    - Name, Quantity (editable), EstimatedPrice, CategoryTag, FocusIcon, Checkbox, Edit/Delete
    - UserAvatar (who added)
  - `AISuggestionButton`
  - `AISuggestionCard[]` (if suggestions open)

- `AddItemForm`
  - AutocompleteInput (name)
  - QuantityInput
  - CategoryDropdown
  - AddButton

- `PurchasedHistory`
  - PurchasedItemCard[] (faded, with date, restore button)

- `AnalyticsPanel` (collapsible)
  - AverageUsage, Frequency, BudgetTrends

- `ReminderBanner`
  - LowStockAlert, OneTapAdd

- `ActivityLog` (collapsible/tab)
  - RecentActions

- `FooterNav`
  - ShoppingList, Analytics, History, Settings

## 3. Key Interactions

- **Add/Edit/Remove Item:**  
  - Add: via `AddItemForm` (with autocomplete, category, quantity)
  - Edit/Delete: via icons on each item card
- **Mark as Bought:**  
  - Checkbox on item card → moves to `PurchasedHistory`
- **AI Suggestions:**  
  - Button triggers fetch/generate suggestions, display as cards, add with one click
- **Focus Item:**  
  - Star/flag icon toggles focus
- **Categorize:**  
  - Category tag on card, set via dropdown
- **Restore Purchased:**  
  - Restore button on purchased item moves it back to active list
- **Analytics:**  
  - Panel shows usage, frequency, budget (charts, stats)
- **Reminders:**  
  - Banner/notification for low-stock, one-tap add
- **Multi-user:**  
  - Real-time updates, avatars on items, activity log

## 4. UI/UX Notes

- **Color Palette:**  
  - Use pastel blues, greens, yellows for backgrounds, category tags, and highlights.
- **Typography:**  
  - Sans-serif, e.g., Quicksand, Roboto, or similar.
- **Icons:**  
  - Use minimal SVGs for edit, delete, focus, restore, settings, etc.

## 5. Anticipated Needs

- **WebSocket/Realtime API** for multi-user sync.
- **Autocomplete API** for item names.
- **AI Suggestion Service** (can be mocked initially).
- **Analytics Service** for stats.
- **Notification/Reminder Service** for low-stock.
- **Role-based access** for user management.
- **Unit and E2E tests** for all public methods and UI flows.
