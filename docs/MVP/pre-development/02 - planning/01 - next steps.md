### Prompt

You are single fullstack developer and you are going to lauch a whole project in several iterations.
At the moment we defined the main idea, name, and tech stack of the app - what should you do next?

### Result

Next steps, assuming you have the idea, name, and tech stack:

1. **Define MVP scope**  
   List the absolute minimum features needed for a usable product. Ruthlessly cut anything non-essential.

2. **Sketch UI/UX**  
   Quick wireframes (Figma, Excalidraw, pen & paper). Don’t overthink it—just enough to clarify flows.

3. **Set up project repo**  
   - Create a GitHub/GitLab repo.
   - Add a README with the project vision, stack, and MVP scope.
   - Set up .gitignore, license, and basic docs.

4. **Bootstrap the project**  
   - Scaffold backend and frontend with your chosen stack (e.g., Next.js, Express, etc.).
   - Set up linting, formatting, and basic CI (GitHub Actions is fine).
   - Add a simple landing page with the app name and “coming soon.”

5. **Plan iterations**  
   - Break MVP into 1-2 week sprints.
   - Prioritize features by user value and technical risk.

6. **Set up deployment**  
   - Pick a host (Vercel, Netlify, DigitalOcean, etc.).
   - Deploy the skeleton app so you have a live URL from day one.

7. **Start building features**  
   - Tackle the riskiest/most complex features first.
   - Commit and push code often.

8. **Feedback loop**  
   - Share progress with a few trusted users or friends.
   - Adjust scope/UX based on feedback.

**Restated:**  
After idea, name, and stack, you should define the MVP, sketch the UI, set up the repo, scaffold the project, plan iterations, deploy a skeleton, and start building features—always with a feedback loop.
