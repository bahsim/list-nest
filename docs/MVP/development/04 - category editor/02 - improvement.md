### Prompt

the list of categories should look like a list and its records should be editible by one

**Restated:**  
You want the Category Editor to display categories as a true list (vertical, clear separation), and each category row should be editable one-at-a-time (inline editing, not all at once).

**How to do it:**
- Render categories in a vertical list (use MUI `List`/`ListItem` or just styled `Box`).
- Each row: show name and color, with an edit button (pencil icon).
- When "edit" is clicked, that row becomes editable (name as input, color as select), others stay static.
- Save/cancel buttons for the editing row.

**Want me to implement this logic in your `CategoryEditor`?**  
It will:
- Allow inline editing of a single category at a time (name + color).
- Show edit/save/cancel actions per row.
- Keep the rest of the list static while editing.

### Prompt 

mobile first design should be easyli accessible by tapping

### Result

Got it.  
**Mobile-first, easily tappable, accessible Category Editor:**
- Each category row is a large, touch-friendly card or list item.
- Tapping anywhere on a row enters edit mode for that row.
- In edit mode:  
  - Name becomes a text field, color is a dropdown (or color picker).
  - Save/cancel buttons are big and easy to tap.
- Only one row editable at a time.
- Use MUI List/ListItem or Card, with spacing and touch targets â‰¥48px.
- All controls have proper `aria-label`, keyboard navigation, and focus ring.

**Want me to implement this in your `CategoryEditor`?**  
It will be:
- Mobile-first, accessible, and touch-friendly.
- Only one row editable at a time, with clear tap targets.

Ready to go?

- Category Editor is now mobile-first, accessible, and touch-friendly.
- Each row is a large, tappable list item.
- Tapping a row enables inline editing (name + color) for that row only.
- Save/cancel are big, easy to tap, and accessible.
- Only one row editable at a time.

UI/UX is now much better for mobile and accessibility.
