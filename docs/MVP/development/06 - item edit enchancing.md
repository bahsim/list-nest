Consider about how to make this @add-edit-item-modal.tsx form user-freindly.
The form is to be shown in several situations:
- adding new item
- editing an item
- completing an item
There is a set of input fields: name, quantity, unit, notes, estimated price, category. Only Name is mandatory.
Quantity and unit are coupled and come together, also they have default values 1 pcs.
By default only Name field is available for input. Others fields are displayed as a set of chip-buttons (add price, add quantity, add note, add category, etc)
When we add note, for example, first then it appears afte default quantity and unit becuase buttons always below
So the field have 3 conditional states - opened, default, empty
- Do not stop working on this until you've implemented this feature fully and completely.
- Before you answer, write two detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of these solutions, do not jump to conclusions, then tell me which one is better and why.
- Answer in short

### Result

**Argument for “Progressive Disclosure with Chip-Buttons” (your described approach):**  
This method keeps the form minimal and focused, reducing cognitive load. Users see only the Name field at first, which is the only required input, and can add more details as needed via chip-buttons (“Add quantity”, “Add price”, etc). This is great for speed and mobile UX, as it avoids overwhelming the user with unnecessary fields. It also supports the “add, edit, complete” flows seamlessly: for quick adds, users just type a name and hit save; for more detail, they progressively reveal fields. The chip-buttons are visually distinct, inviting interaction, and the dynamic field order (e.g., notes appearing after quantity/unit if added first) keeps the form logical and tidy. This approach is modern, aligns with best UX practices, and is easy to extend with new fields.

**Argument for “Always Show All Fields” (classic form):**  
Showing all fields at once is explicit and predictable. Users see every possible input up front, which can be reassuring for power users or those who always fill in all details. There’s no hidden functionality, so there’s less risk of users missing an option. It’s also easier to implement and test, with fewer conditional states and less UI complexity. For editing or completing items, all fields are immediately available for review and update, which can speed up workflows for users who routinely use all fields. This approach is conventional and familiar, reducing the learning curve.

**Which is better and why:**  
The progressive disclosure with chip-buttons is better for this use case. It’s more user-friendly for the majority, especially on mobile, and supports both quick and detailed entry. It keeps the UI clean, reduces friction, and is more engaging. The classic form is only preferable if your users always fill every field, which is rare for shopping lists. Progressive disclosure is more modern, flexible, and scalable.

**Restated Query:**  
You want to make the add-edit-item-modal form user-friendly by showing only the Name field by default, with other fields revealed via chip-buttons, and you want a thorough, reasoned comparison before implementation. The progressive chip-button approach is superior for your context. Next, I’ll implement this feature in your code.

- “Progressive disclosure with chip-buttons” keeps the form minimal, focused, and fast for most users, especially on mobile. It’s modern, reduces cognitive load, and is easy to extend. It’s best for quick adds and supports detailed entry when needed.
- “Always show all fields” is explicit, predictable, and familiar. It’s easier to implement and test, and good for power users who always fill every field, but it can overwhelm and slow down most users.

**Progressive disclosure is better for your use case**: it’s more user-friendly, flexible, and modern for a shopping list app where most users only care about the name, and only sometimes want to add details.

**Restated**: You want a modal that, by default, only shows the Name field, with chip-buttons to reveal (and then show in the form) quantity/unit (default 1 pcs), price, notes, and category. Each field has three states: default (chip), opened (input), empty (not shown). The order is: Name, then revealed fields, then chip-buttons.

I’ll now refactor your modal to implement this.

- Progressive disclosure (chip-buttons) is better for your modal: it keeps the UI clean, fast, and user-friendly, especially for quick adds and mobile.
- Classic “all fields visible” is only better if users always fill every field, which is rare for shopping lists.

I’ve updated your modal to:
- Show only the Name field by default (required).
- Show chip-buttons for: Add quantity & unit (default 1 pcs), Add price, Add note, Add category.
- Clicking a chip reveals the corresponding input, in order, above the chips.
- Quantity/unit are coupled.
- Each field has three states: default (chip), opened (input), empty (not shown).

You now have a modern, minimal, and flexible add/edit/complete modal. If you want further tweaks (e.g., field order, chip style, auto-open on edit), just say so.
