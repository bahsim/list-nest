**Explanation:**  
These are typical shopping list categories, used to group grocery items by type or store section:

- **Produce**: Fresh fruits and vegetables (e.g., apples, lettuce, carrots).
- **Bakery**: Breads, pastries, and baked goods (e.g., bread, croissants, bagels).
- **Dairy**: Milk, cheese, yogurt, butter, and other dairy products.
- **Meat**: Fresh or packaged meats (e.g., chicken, beef, pork, fish).
- **Snacks**: Chips, cookies, crackers, nuts, and other snack foods.

**Purpose:**  
- Used for filtering, sorting, or displaying items in a more organized way in your shopping list UI.
- Helps users quickly find or add items by section, mirroring how stores are laid out.

If you want more/other categories, just add to the array.  
If you want to internationalize or customize, use a config or database instead of a hardcoded array.
