### Prompt 

Check @ui-kit on complience with @summary.md 

### Result

You want a compliance check of your `/frontend/ui-kit` implementation against the design/brand system described in `summary.md`. Here’s a direct, detailed approach:

**Restating your query:**  
You want a thorough, code-level audit of your `@ui-kit` (in `/frontend/ui-kit`) to see if it matches the design system, tokens, and accessibility rules in `summary.md`. You want specifics, not generalities.

**What I’ll do:**
- Check if all tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows) are present and correctly named/typed in `/ui-kit/tokens/`.
- Check if components use these tokens (not hardcoded values).
- Check if components match atomic design, states/variants, and accessibility rules.
- Check for correct font usage, icon style, motion, and content guidelines.
- Check for compliance with accessibility and brand rules.

**What I need to do next:**  
- List and inspect the contents of `/frontend/ui-kit/tokens/` and `/frontend/ui-kit/components/` to see the actual code and tokens.
- Check for usage of tokens in components.
- Check for accessibility features in components.

Let’s start by listing the files in `tokens` and `components` to see what’s implemented.

**Compliance check of @ui-kit with summary.md:**

### 1. **Design Tokens**
- **Colors:** All palette colors from summary.md are present in `colors.ts` as TS constants.  
  **BUT:** Components use hardcoded hex values in SCSS, not tokens (e.g., `background: #D1E7DD;` in `AISuggestionButton`, `#4A90E2` in `CategoryDropdown`).  
  **Fix:** Refactor SCSS to use CSS vars or import tokens.
- **Typography:** Font families, weights, and sizes are in `typography.ts` and match the spec.  
  **BUT:** SCSS uses hardcoded values, not tokens.
- **Spacing, Radii, Shadows:** All tokens are present as TS constants and SCSS, matching the spec.  
  **BUT:** SCSS uses hardcoded values (e.g., `border-radius: 8px;`), not tokens.

### 2. **Atomic Design**
- **Atoms:** Button, input, icon, card, etc. exist as atomic components.
- **Molecules/Organisms:** Present and named as per atomic design.
- **States/Variants:** Some states (e.g., `voiceButton--listening`) are present, but not all variants from summary.md are visible in code (e.g., `isHovered`, `isEditing`).

### 3. **Accessibility**
- **Aria-labels:** Present on interactive elements (e.g., `aria-label="Show AI Suggestions"`).
- **Roles:** Used in modal overlay (`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`).
- **Focus ring, keyboard nav, high-contrast:** Not visible in code reviewed.  
  **Fix:** Add focus-visible styles, keyboard handlers, and high-contrast mode toggle.

### 4. **Brand/Visual**
- **Fonts:** Correct fonts in tokens, but not enforced in SCSS.
- **Icons:** Uses MUI icons, which are line-based and rounded.
- **Colors:** Brand colors are present, but not always used via tokens.
- **Motion:** No animation/motion in code reviewed.  
  **Fix:** Add subtle transitions for hover/active states.

### 5. **Content**
- **Labels, placeholders:** Match content guidelines.
- **No color as sole info:** Not always clear (e.g., category color in `HistoryItemRow`).

### 6. **Other**
- **Storybook:** Exists for at least one component.
- **No use of magic numbers in TS, but present in SCSS.**

## **Summary of Issues & Fixes**
- **SCSS uses hardcoded values** for color, spacing, radii, etc.  
  → **Refactor to use CSS custom properties or import tokens.**
- **Not all component states/variants are implemented.**  
  → **Add missing states/variants.**
- **Accessibility is decent but missing focus/keyboard/high-contrast.**  
  → **Add focus-visible, keyboard nav, and high-contrast support.**
- **No motion/animation.**  
  → **Add transitions for interactive elements.**
- **Fonts/tokens not enforced in SCSS.**  
  → **Set font-family, font-size, etc. via tokens.**

**If you want a code sample for refactoring SCSS to use tokens, or a checklist for compliance, just say so.**  
**If you want a full audit for a specific component, name it.**
