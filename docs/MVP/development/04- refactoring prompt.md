#### Prompt

Seems that kind of imlementation is not good accroding to KISS principle, would be tricky to reproduce it every time when we implement base-list component.
Act as a pro and reflect on it is better on not to move some functionality into base-list component from soppin-list-item-card

### Result

Great point. Here’s a pro-level reflection:

---

#### The tradeoff

- **Current approach:**  
  - All swipe visuals (icon, color, etc) are handled in the feature via a render prop.
  - The base just exposes swipe state (`translateX`), and the feature decides what to show.
  - **Pros:** Max flexibility, all business logic stays in the feature.
  - **Cons:** Every feature has to reimplement the same “swipe icon/color” logic, which is not KISS or DRY.

---

#### When to move logic to the base

- If the **swipe visual pattern is always the same** (e.g., “swipe left = warning, swipe right = success, icons based on state”),  
  **move it to the base** and let the feature just pass a config or a mapping.
- If **every feature wants different visuals**, keep it as a render prop.

---

#### Pro recommendation

**For most apps:**  
- Move the “swipe icon/color” logic into the base, but make it configurable:
  - Accept a `getSwipeVisuals` prop (or similar) in the base.
  - By default, use a standard implementation (the one you have now).
  - If a feature needs something custom, it can override.

**API example:**
```tsx
export interface BaseListItemCardProps {
  // ...
  getSwipeVisuals?: (args: { translateX: number; item: T; theme: Theme }) => { actionIcon: React.ReactNode; actionBg: string };
}
```
- The base calls this function (or its default) and renders the visuals.
- The feature only provides it if it needs to override.

---

#### KISS Principle

- **KISS = Don’t make every feature reimplement the same logic.**
- If 90% of the time the visuals are the same, put it in the base.
- Only expose a render prop or config for the rare custom case.

---

#### TL;DR

- If you want KISS and DRY:  
  **Move the swipe visuals logic into the base, make it configurable.**
- If you want max flexibility and don’t mind a little boilerplate:  
  Keep it as a render prop.

**Want me to refactor so the swipe visuals logic is in the base, with a config/override option?**  
Just say so.
