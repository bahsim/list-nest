### Prompt

There is a main-list feature.@main-list 
Act as a Pro Lead Developer and consider about spliting on two
- main list
- <list item>

Before you answer, write two detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of these solutions, do not jump to conclusions, then tell me which one is better and why

### Result

**Argument for Keeping a Single “main-list” Feature:**  
Keeping everything under a single `main-list` feature directory is simple and can be effective for small to medium-sized projects or when the domain is tightly focused. This approach makes it easy to find all related code in one place—components, hooks, context, types, and utilities are all grouped together, which can speed up onboarding and navigation for new developers. It also reduces the risk of over-engineering or premature abstraction, which can be a real problem in early-stage or rapidly evolving projects. If the “list item” logic is not especially complex or reused elsewhere, keeping it as a sub-component or utility within the main-list feature keeps the codebase flat and easy to reason about. Refactoring is also easier when everything is in one place, and you avoid the overhead of managing multiple feature boundaries.

**Argument for Splitting into “main-list” and “list-item” Features:**  
Splitting into two features—`main-list` and `list-item`—follows the single responsibility principle and sets you up for better scalability and reusability. As your app grows, the logic and UI for a single list item (editing, actions, display, validation, etc.) can become substantial and may be reused in other contexts (e.g., a search result, a favorites list, or a history view). By isolating `list-item` as its own feature, you make it easier to test, maintain, and evolve independently of the main list logic. This separation also encourages better encapsulation: the main list only cares about rendering and managing a collection, while the list item handles its own state, UI, and actions. This modularity is especially valuable in larger teams or when you anticipate future features like drag-and-drop, item-level permissions, or cross-feature item usage.

**Which is better and why?**  
Splitting into `main-list` and `list-item` is the better approach for any project that expects to grow, needs reusability, or values clean architecture. It enforces separation of concerns, makes your codebase more modular, and future-proofs you against feature creep. You can still colocate “list item” under “main-list” as a sub-feature if you want to avoid polluting the top-level features directory, but the key is to give list items their own space and contract. This makes testing, refactoring, and onboarding easier as the codebase scales. The only reason to keep everything together is if you’re certain the project will remain small and the item logic will never be reused—but that’s rarely true in real-world apps.
