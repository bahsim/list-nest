### Prompt

Let's consider step by step development
1. Empty Main List View screen, with no list
2. Creating a list result empty list with no items in it
3. etc 

Act as an Expert of decomposition of tasks and give kinda granular tasks

### Result

Sure, here’s a granular, step-by-step breakdown for developing the “Main List View” feature, from zero state to full functionality:

---

### 1. **Empty Main List View Screen**
- Set up route and page/component for Main List View.
- Render page with header, footer, and empty state placeholder (no list, no items).
- Add brand logo, user avatar, and settings icon in header.
- Add footer navigation (inactive states).

---

### 2. **Create a List (No Items)**
- Implement “Create New List” action/button if list doesn’t exist.
- On creation, show empty list state (list exists, but no items).
- Display “No items yet” message and call-to-action to add first item.

---

### 3. **Add Item Form**
- Add “Add Item” form (input fields: name, quantity, category, price).
- Validate required fields, show errors if missing.
- “Add” button is disabled until form is valid.

---

### 4. **Display List with Items**
- Render list of items as cards/rows after adding.
- Each item shows: name, quantity, price, category, focus, bought, user avatar, edit/delete.
- Support empty state if all items are deleted.

---

### 5. **Mark as Bought / Move to History**
- Add checkbox to mark item as bought.
- On check, move item to purchased history section.
- Show purchased history (faded style, restore button).

---

### 6. **Edit/Delete Items**
- Add edit and delete icons to each item.
- Edit opens modal/form pre-filled with item data.
- Delete removes item from list (with confirmation).

---

### 7. **Filter/Sort List**
- Add filter/sort controls (by name, category, price, etc.).
- Update list display based on selected filter/sort.

---

### 8. **Bulk Actions**
- Add multi-select checkboxes for bulk actions.
- Implement bulk delete, bulk mark as bought.

---

### 9. **Real-Time Updates & Persistence**
- Connect to backend or local storage for data persistence.
- Implement real-time updates (WebSocket or polling) for multi-user sync.

---

### 10. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**
- Ensure all controls are keyboard accessible.
- Add ARIA labels and roles.
- Test and adjust layout for mobile and desktop.

---

### 11. **Branding & Atomic Design**
- Apply brand colors, typography, and atomic design system to all components.
- Use atomic components (atoms, molecules, organisms) for UI.

---

### 12. **Error, Loading, and Edge States**
- Show loading spinner while fetching data.
- Show error message if data fetch fails.
- Handle edge cases: very long lists (pagination/infinite scroll), offline mode.

---

### 13. **Testing**
- Write unit tests for each component and function.
- Write integration tests for user flows (add, edit, delete, mark as bought).
- Add smoke test endpoint to controller.

---

**You can break down each of these steps further if needed (e.g., separate UI and logic, separate mobile/desktop tweaks, etc).**
