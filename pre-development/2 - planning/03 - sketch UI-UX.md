### Prompt

Act as UI/UX Designer
Consult me on choosing a right tool to make quick wireframes (Figma, Excalidraw, pen & paper). 
I don't have experience and further am going to request AI Agent and give as an input what I am drawing

### Result

Use Excalidraw. Here’s why:

- Dead simple, zero learning curve—just drag, drop, and sketch.
- Free, open source, runs in browser (no install, no signup needed).
- Looks hand-drawn, so nobody expects pixel-perfect design.
- Super fast for rough flows, boxes, arrows, and text.
- Easy to export as PNG/SVG for sharing or AI input.
- Figma is overkill for quick wireframes if you’re not already familiar.
- Pen & paper is fine, but digitizing for AI input is a pain (scanning, cleaning up).

If you want to hand off to an AI Agent, Excalidraw’s exports are clean and easy to use as input. You can even copy SVG code directly.

Restated:  
You want a tool for quick, no-experience wireframes, and plan to use the output as AI input. Excalidraw is your best bet—fast, free, and perfect for rough UI sketches.


### Prompt

Consult me on this point
- Quick wireframes (Excalidraw). Don’t overthink it—just enough to clarify flows.


### Result

Just make a few rough screens in Excalidraw — don’t aim for pixel-perfect UI, just block out the main flows. Focus on:

- Main shopping list view: List of items, add/edit/remove buttons, “mark as bought” checkbox, maybe a GenAI suggestion button.
- Add/edit item modal: Fields for name, quantity, (optional) price, and a save/cancel.
- Simple history view: List of bought items.
- (Optional) GenAI suggestion popup: Show suggested items, accept/reject buttons.
- Minimal navigation: Maybe tabs or a sidebar for “List” and “History”.

Use rectangles for sections, lines/arrows for flow, and text labels. Don’t bother with colors, icons, or branding yet. The goal is to clarify what screens you need and how users move between them, not to design the final look.

Restated: Just sketch the core screens and flows in Excalidraw, keep it ugly and fast, and focus on what the user can do on each screen.
