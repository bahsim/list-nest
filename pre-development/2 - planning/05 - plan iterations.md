### Prompt

Act as Senior Business Analyst and break MVP into 1-2 week sprints, prioritize features by user value and technical risk

### Result

Sprint breakdown for your GenAI-powered collaborative grocery shopping app MVP, prioritized by user value and technical risk:

Sprint 1 (Week 1):
- User can create a single shopping list (core, zero risk)
- Add items to the list manually (name, quantity, optional price) (core, low risk)
- Simple UI: view, add, edit, remove, mark as bought (core, low risk)
- List persists between sessions (local storage) (core, low risk, enables real use)

Sprint 2 (Week 2):
- Edit or remove items from the list (core, low risk, but needs more UI/UX)
- Mark items as bought (move to simple history) (core, low risk, but needs state management)
- Basic GenAI suggestion: suggest 1-2 items based on previous history (high user value, moderate risk—first AI integration)
- List persists between sessions (simple backend, if needed for future extensibility) (medium risk, sets up for future features)

Rationale:
- Sprint 1 is all about core CRUD and persistence, so users can actually use the app for its main purpose.
- Sprint 2 adds history, editing, and the GenAI suggestion, which is the “wow” feature and has the most technical risk.
- If GenAI is too risky, start backend persistence in parallel or as a fallback.

Flag: If you want to de-risk GenAI, spike it in Sprint 1 as a time-boxed experiment.

Restated:  
Sprint 1 = CRUD, local persistence, basic UI.  
Sprint 2 = Edit/remove, bought/history, GenAI suggestion, backend persistence (optional/parallel).
