### Prompt

Act as Product Owner
Up to now, prepared plan ierations, ompleted stepes up to 6 (deployed successfully front and backend), skethes are ready in details.
what are further steps?

### Result

You’ve done the following:
- Defined MVP
- Sketched UI/UX (detailed)
- Set up repo, docs, CI
- Bootstrapped backend/frontend
- Planned sprints/iterations
- Deployed skeleton (front+back)

**Next steps (as Product Owner, post-deployment, pre-feature build):**

1. **Sprint Planning & Backlog Grooming**
   - Break down MVP features into granular, actionable tickets (user stories, tasks, bugs).
   - Prioritize by user value, dependencies, and technical risk.
   - Add acceptance criteria to each ticket.
   - Use a board (GitHub Projects, Jira, etc.) for visibility.

2. **Dev Environment Finalization**
   - Ensure local dev setup is frictionless (README, scripts, env vars, mock data).
   - Add sample data for rapid UI/UX iteration.

3. **Feature Development (Start Sprint 1)**
   - Build core CRUD for shopping list (as per your plan).
   - Implement local persistence.
   - Ship vertical slices (end-to-end, even if ugly).

4. **Testing Foundation**
   - Set up unit and integration test scaffolding (Jest for NestJS, etc.).
   - Write smoke tests for each controller/service as you go.

5. **Feedback Loop**
   - Share early builds with trusted users.
   - Collect feedback on usability, bugs, and feature gaps.
   - Adjust backlog and priorities based on real feedback.

6. **Documentation**
   - Keep README and API docs up to date.
   - Document endpoints, data models, and setup steps.

7. **Prepare for Next Sprint**
   - Review what’s done, what’s blocked, and what’s next.
   - Refine backlog, re-prioritize if needed.

8. **(Optional, but smart)**
   - Spike risky features (e.g., GenAI suggestion) in parallel, time-boxed.
   - Set up error monitoring/logging (Sentry, etc.) for early bug detection.

**Restated:**  
You’re ready to move from planning to execution. Break features into tickets, prioritize, finalize dev setup, start building core features, set up tests, get feedback, and iterate. Keep docs and backlog fresh. Spike risky stuff early if possible.
