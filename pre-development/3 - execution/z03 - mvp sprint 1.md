### Prompt

Act as a cool Senior BA
Consider plan iteration and prepare user stories for  MVP Sprint in BA style

### Result

Sure, here are user stories for your MVP Sprint (Sprint 1), BA-style, for a GenAI-powered collaborative grocery shopping app. Each story is atomic, testable, and includes acceptance criteria. I’ll keep it tight and practical.

#### User Story 6: List Persists Between Sessions

**Sprint Goal:**  
User can create, view, edit, and persist a shopping list with items, using a simple UI. No backend or GenAI yet—just core CRUD and local storage.

If you want, I can break these into subtasks, add test cases, or prep for Jira/GitHub. Just say the word.
