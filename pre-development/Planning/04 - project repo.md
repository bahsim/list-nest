### Prompt

As an Senior Fullstack Developer and Senior Business Analyst prepare a README file with the project vision, stack, and MVP scope,  set up .gitignore, license, and basic docs.

### Result

You get:
README.md with project vision, stack, and MVP scope (references detailed docs)
.gitignore for a fullstack TS monorepo (NestJS, React, Vite, Prisma, etc)
LICENSE (MIT, permissive, standard for OSS)
docs/overview.md (project summary, vision, stack, MVP, with links to detailed docs)
All docs reference your actual planning/vision files, so you donâ€™t lose detail. If you want a CONTRIBUTING.md, code of conduct, or API/data model boilerplate, just say so.
