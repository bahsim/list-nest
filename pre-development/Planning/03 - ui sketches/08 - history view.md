### Prompt

Illustrate an interface for a family grocery shopping list app, powered by AI. The interface should feature a shared shopping list where users can add items manually or accept AI-generated suggestions. Each item should display quantity and estimated prices. The app should also provide autocomplete options as users type. There should be a provision to mark items as 'focused' and a possibility to categorize the items. There should be a section where purchased items checked off are moved into the history. The app should be capable of tracking and analyzing item quantities and costs providing average usage, frequency, and budget trends. The interface should also feature a reminder system for staple items running low and multi-user support for real-time collaboration.

Describe the following interface
- Simple history view: List of bought items.

### Result

#### **Simple History View: Interface Description**

The **Simple History View** is designed to provide users with a clean and organized overview of items that have been purchased and checked off from the shopping list. It serves as a record for tracking past purchases, analyzing trends, and restoring items if needed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the interface:

---

#### **1. Header Section**
- **Title**: A clear title at the top of the screen, such as "Purchase History."
- **Back Button**: A small arrow or "Back" button in the top-left corner to return to the main shopping list view.
- **Search Bar**: A search field at the top allows users to quickly find specific items in the history (e.g., "Search for 'Milk'").

#### **2. History List**
The main section displays a chronological list of purchased items, grouped by purchase date for easy navigation.

##### **Grouping by Date**
- **Date Headers**: Each group is labeled with the purchase date (e.g., "October 10, 2023").
- **Expandable/Collapsible Groups**: Users can expand or collapse date groups to declutter the view.

##### **Item Display**
Each item is displayed as a row or card with the following details:
- **Item Name**: Bold text for the name of the item (e.g., "Milk").
- **Quantity**: Smaller text next to the name (e.g., "2 liters").
- **Price**: Estimated price displayed in smaller text below the item name (e.g., "$3.50").
- **Category Tag**: A small, color-coded label indicating the category (e.g., "Dairy," "Vegetables").
- **Focus Indicator**: If the item was marked as "focused" in the shopping list, a small icon or flag appears next to the name.
- **User Attribution**: A small avatar or initials next to the item name indicate which family member checked off the item.

#### **3. Restore Functionality**
Each item includes an option to restore it to the active shopping list:
- **Restore Button**: A small button or icon (e.g., a circular arrow) next to each item allows users to move it back to the shopping list.
- **Confirmation Prompt**: Clicking "Restore" triggers a confirmation message (e.g., "Restore 'Milk' to the shopping list?").

#### **4. Analytics Summary**
At the top or bottom of the history view, there’s a collapsible panel or summary section providing insights based on the history:

- **Total Spending**: Shows the total estimated cost of purchased items (e.g., "Total: $150.75").
- **Frequent Items**: Highlights items purchased most often (e.g., "Eggs: 5 times this month").
- **Categories Breakdown**: A pie chart or bar graph showing the percentage of spending by category (e.g., "Dairy: 30%, Vegetables: 25%").

#### **5. Filters**
A filter section allows users to customize the view:
- **Category Filter**: Dropdown or checkboxes to filter items by category (e.g., "Show only Dairy").
