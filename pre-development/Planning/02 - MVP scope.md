### Prompt 

Act as Senior Business Analyst
Let's define MVP scope - list the absolute minimum features needed for a usable product. Ruthlessly cut anything non-essential.

### Result

MVP scope for your GenAI-powered collaborative grocery shopping app (absolute bare minimum, everything else is a nice-to-have):

- User can create a single shopping list (no categories, no multi-list support)
- Add items to the list manually (name, quantity, optional price)
- Edit or remove items from the list
- Mark items as bought (move to simple history)
- List persists between sessions (local storage or simple backend)
- Basic GenAI suggestion: suggest 1-2 items based on previous history (no advanced analytics, just simple recall)
- Simple UI: view, add, edit, remove, mark as bought

Cut for MVP (not included):
- Multi-user/collaboration
- Categories or grouping
- Notes (item or list level)
- Advanced analytics (usage, budget, trends)
- Reminders/notifications
- Focused items
- Real-time sync
- Advanced GenAI (pattern analysis, smart suggestions)
- Price tracking/analytics

Restated:  
MVP = single-user, single-list, add/edit/remove/mark items, basic GenAI suggestion, persistent storage, simple UI. Everything else is extra.
