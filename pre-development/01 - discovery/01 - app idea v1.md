### Result

A GenAI-powered grocery app for households that auto-generates daily/weekly shopping lists. Users can edit the list—change quantities, add/remove items, and add notes (list-level or item-level). The list becomes a live checklist for shopping, with the ability to check off or update items on the go. When done, the list is archived for history. The app tracks and analyzes product quantities over time, so you can see trends like how often you buy certain items or your average usage, but it doesn’t track prices or spending.

Reflection:
- GenAI suggests items and quantities based on your history and patterns.
- You get analytics on product usage (e.g., “You buy bread 3x/month, avg. 2 loaves each time”).
- No money stuff—just quantities and frequency.
- Notes and collaborative editing are still in.
- Shopping history is searchable and repeatable.
- Could add reminders when you’re running low on frequently used items.

Want a feature breakdown, data model, or code sample for the analytics part?
